##Description

This single-page application (SPA) can be used to create custom polls.


##Technologies Used

###Node.js

Node.jsÂ® is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine. Node.js uses an event-driven, non-blocking I/O model that makes it lightweight and efficient. Node.js' package ecosystem, npm, is the largest ecosystem of open source libraries in the world.

###Express:

Express is a minimal and flexible Node.js web application framework that provides a robust set of features for web and mobile application

###Passport

Passport is authentication middleware for Node.js. Extremely flexible and modular, Passport can be unobtrusively dropped in to any Express-based web application. A comprehensive set of strategies support authentication using a username and password, Facebook, Twitter, and more.

###Mongoose

Mongoose is used for elegant mongodb object modeling for node.js. Mongoose provides a straight-forward, schema-based solution to model application data. It includes built-in type casting, validation, query building, business logic hooks etc.

###MongoDB

It is a cross-platform document-oriented database.
Classified as a NoSQL database, MongoDB eschews the traditional table-based relational database structure in favor of JSON-like documents with dynamic schemas (MongoDB calls the format BSON), making the integration of data in certain types of applications easier and faster.
MongoDB is free and open-source software.

###jQuery

jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation, event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers. With a combination of versatility and extensibility, jQuery has changed the way that millions of people write JavaScript.

###Javacript

JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, untyped, and interpreted programming language. Alongside HTML and CSS, it is one of the three essential technologies of World Wide Web content production; the majority of websites employ it and it is supported by all modern web browsers without plug-ins. JavaScript is prototype-based with first-class functions, making it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.

###HTML5

HTML5 is a markup language used for structuring and presenting content on the World Wide Web.

###CSS3

CSS3 is a style sheet language used for describing the presentation of a document written in a markup language.

###Git

Git is a free and open source distributed version control system designed to handle everything from small to very large projects with speed and efficiency.

##Unsolved Problems

- Cannot update a poll on the front-end
- We can display a unique poll URL but cannot currently get the URL to show anything other than JSON.
- Cannot display poll results on the front-end (but the aggregation of votes works on the back end)

##Major Hurdles

- Picking a data model/schema and sticking to it. We vacillated between what schema we were going to use for way too long.
- De-scoping
  - Due to time restraints we had to hard code various aspects just to get more features working
- When splitting up work as the deadline came closer, we ran into some difficult merge conflicts.

##Areas of Growth

- Git control
- Group communication
- Javascript familiarity

##Future Additions

- jQuery animations and general UX
- Real time results
